* [[file:~/Desktop/Archive/Reference/tool/editor/emacs/orgmode.orgTutorials/orgmode.orgTutorials.org][org mode Tutorials Master File]]
* Used Tutorial Agenda Files
- [[file:mylife.org][Tutorial Agenda File]] for E01 and E02
  - it's [[file:myarchive.org][Archive File]]
- [[file:checklist.org][Tutorial DailyPlan File]]
- [[file:mylife03.org][Tutorial Agenda File3]] for E03
  - it's [[file:myarchive03.org][Archive File]]
- Split of [[file:mylife03.org][Tutorial Agenda File3]] for E03S02:
  - [[file:mywork03.org][Tutorial Agenda File3: Work]] (same archive)
    - it's [[file:workarchive03.org][Archive File]]
  - [[file:mylife03.org][Tutorial Agenda File3]] for private stuff
  - [[file:mylife03_backupBeforeSplitupInE03S02.org][Backup of Tutorial Agenda File3 before splitup]]

* Preliminary Remarks
- in these notes, I confuse a bit the org mode terminology.
  - Org calls *stuff preceded by asterisks* a =heading=, and *list items* an
    =item=. So from org terminology perspective, an item is not a heading, and a
    heading is not an item. I here call headings items often. Proof:
    ~org-next-item~ works only on list items, ~org-next-heading~ only on
    headings.
  - A =task= is always a heading. A heading maybe a task. I sometimes call
    tasks 'todo items' or similar.
  - A task has always a =task keyword=. I often call these todo keywords or
    similar.
  - A heading may have one =tag= or more. A tag is an independent concept of
    task keywords.
* Customizations
- Rainer does customizations via a GUI / ~customize-variable~ (emacs manages
  elisp code). I gathered all in one snippet in my [[file:~/.emacs.d/init.el::;;%20JW%20added%2020181104:%20Customizations%20from%20youtube%20Rainer%20K%C3%B6nig%20Orgmode%20tutorial%20START][init.el]] (user manages elisp
  code), by copying the stuff emacs wrote under ~custom-set-variables~ when
  Rainer's customizations were applied.

 - stuff already known
 -                                                emacs               spacemacs
 - org-refile an item/subtree                     =C-c C=w=           =M-RET r=
   - we use that here to /move a headline/item under another top level
     headline/item/.
   - *Note*: Rainer says the key is =C-c C-w=. However, in my Spacemacs, the
     only keybinding for ~org-refile~ is =M-RET- r=.

- adding todos to [[file:orgmodetutorial_rainerkoenig_todos.org::*%5b%5bfile:orgmodetutorial_rainerkoenig.org%5d%5bmaster%20file%5d%5d][tutorial agenda file]]
- cycle todos                                     =c-s left / right=
- cycle todos, with shortcuts if defined          =c-c c-t=
- set in-file todo sequence example:
  #+begin_src org mode
  #+todo: next(n) todo(t) waiting(w) someday(s) | done(d) cancelled(c)
  #+end_src
  - load line with =c-c c-c= (on line) or =c-x c-v= (in file)
  - =c-c c-t= now accepts shortcuts defined above

- file: [[file:mylife.org][tutorial agenda file]]
- problem: [[file:orgmodetutorial_rainerkoenig_e01s04.org::*weekly%20review][weekly review]]: how to repeat that todo?
- solution: add a *repeater* =+1w= to the timestamp
  - effect: in [[help:org-agenda-list][agenda-list]], every week now has weekly review
  - =y/w/m/d/h=
- repeater 1 month with 3-day warning: =<2005-10-01 sat +1m -3d>=
- in fact, there are three different timestamps:
  | +x  | if last occ. in past and set done,            |
  |     | increments to next occ. of same date,         |
  |     | which may also be in the past                 |
  |-----+-----------------------------------------------|
  | ++x | if last occ. in past and set done,            |
  |     | increments to next *future* occ. of same date |
  |-----+-----------------------------------------------|
  | .+x | if set done, sets next occ. to *now +x*,      |
  |     | so date may change                            |

- de/promote headline/item <-> list item          =c-c -/*=
- rainer: uses *agenda as calendar, and checklists as daily plan*,
  does the daily plan the evening before or in the morning
- progress: add ~[/]~ or ~[%]~ headline and =c-c c-c=
- rainer has a file like that that runs over 2 years with entries for each day
- benefit: easy, searchable, shows ratio of green and red days
- important: as simple as possible: "practice bass" instead of "10:00-12:00 bass
  book xyz exercises abc to def"

  - timeline view has been removed, source [[https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/7hps9j/rip_orgtimeline/][reddit thread]]. recreated it with
    that, by customizing ~org-agenda-custom-commands~ see [[file:~/.emacs.d/init.el::;;%20this%20modified%20version%20(stripped%20down)%20does%20work:][init.el]]. Funnily, it's
    also set under [[file:~/.spacemacs::(custom-set-variables][dotfile: custom-set-variables]].
- todo items of one type only                     =c-c a t=
- todo items of subset, e.g. =next|todo=          =c-c a t=
- match query for tag/prop/todo                   =c-c a m=
- match query for todo only                       =c-c a m=
  - change query                                  =c-u r=
  - example queries:
    - only next phone calls: =phone/next= returns only [[file:orgmodetutorial_rainerkoenig_e01s04.org::*call%20uncle%20tom%20after%20his%20surgery][call uncle tom after his
      surgery]]
    - office work example: u have 10 waiting for other people, query those and
      abarbeit die liste, make done or canceled.
    - it's like a database with different views
    - and if u don't know what you're looking for, you can search
- search with state keyword                       =c-c a s=
  - in file example: search for 'chain'. see that part has been delivered, now
    schedule mounting chain for tomorrow. (note: task since moved to archive,

** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj3qhil-eom&index=8&list=plvtkhbrrv_zkpnbtt_td1cs9pjlu0iide][e02s03: customized agenda views]]
- motivation: custom view to see what's important when the workday begins
- insert new custom agenda view                   =c-c a c=
- example of a custom agenda view that matches tags =phone= and =urgent= (note:
  this has the same effect on dotfile as a ~customize-variable~):
  - click =ins= to insert a new view
    - click =value menu=, select 'command series'
    - enter access key: for this example, we choose =u=
    - enter description: 'urgent things and phone calls'
    - click =ins= after word 'component' to insert a block
      - click =value menu=, select 'tags search'
      - enter match: =urgent= tag
      - click =ins= after words 'remember to quote values:'
      - enter headline: 'urgent things to do'
    - click =ins= after word 'component', 2nd one, to insert another block
      - click =value menu=, select 'tags search'
      - enter match: =phone= tag
      - click =ins= after words 'remember to quote values:'
      - enter headline: 'phone calls to do'
- when saved, the following is written to the dotfile (in spacemacs, in
  ~custom-set-variables~ ):
  #+begin_src elisp
  '(org-agenda-custom-commands
     (quote
      (
       ("u" "urgent things and phone calls"
        ((tags "urgent"
               ((org-agenda-overriding-header "urgent things to do")))
         (tags "phone"
               ((org-agenda-overriding-header "phone calls to do"))))
        nil nil)))) 
  #+end_src
- what =c-c a u= now prints is this:

*** intro
- drawers starts with a line ~:drawername:~ and ends with ~:end:~. this is
  *hidden by default*, compared to other regions like code, and so on.
- reserved drawernames:
  - ~:logbook:~    <- gonna customize that now
  - ~:properties:~ <- future episode snippet
-                                                 emacs               spacemacs    
- org-insert-drawer                               =m-ret d=
*** prep: customize ~org-log-into-drawer~
  - click 'value menu', select =logbook=
  - save
*** application case
- file: [[file:mylife.org][tutorial agenda file]], new item [[file:orgmodetutorial_rainerkoenig_e01s04.org::*consulting%20jobs][consulting jobs]]
- application case: user joe is a time-management coach.
  - he has one consulting job / task / todo item: [[file:orgmodetutorial_rainerkoenig_e01s04.org::*time%20management%20training%20for%20acme%20company][time management training for acme company]]
  - job duration: 5 days
  - task has a drawer ~:people:~ describing the attendees, and an as of yet
    empty drawer ~:logbook:~
  - joe has completed first task, back at hotel, wants to write it up
    - check off first item                        =c-c c-c=
    - org-add-note to current entry               =c-c c-z=
    - take another note
    - the note has been stored into the ~:logbook:~ drawer
    - the ~:logbook:~ is practically a microblog / journal of your task. they
      are helpful. you can look it up again after years. or you have a boss that
      says 'what about task xy?' then you can look into your records = logbook.
      for rainer this is nearly the most important feature in org mode.

- motivation: what to do when done tasks are piling up?
- in header of file [[file:mylife.org][Tutorial Agenda File]], define a new line:
  #+BEGIN_SRC org mode
  #+ARCHIVE: myarchive.org::
  #+END_SRC
- move [[file:myarchive.org::*Drawer%20example%20for%20the%20sreencast][Drawer example for the sreencast]] to the archive:

:END:
*** Automatic :LOGBOOK: entry for item Todo state / status changes
- extend the in-file todo state keywords setting introduced in [[*%5B%5Bhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15w3I6MwCfs&index=2&list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE%5D%5BE01S02: ToDo keywords%5D%5D][E01S02: ToDo keywords]]:
  #+BEGIN_SRC org mode
  From basic hotkeys:
  #+TODO: NEXT(n) TODO(t) WAITING(w) SOMEDAY(s) PROJ(p) | DONE(d) CANCELLED(c)
  to hotkeys with logging:
  #+TODO: NEXT(n/!) TODO(t@/!) WAITING(w@/!) SOMEDAY(s/!) PROJ(p) | DONE(d@) CANCELLED(c)
  # Legend:
  # #+SEQ_TODO: STATE(k@/!)
  # k - hotkey for STATE
  # @ - log a timestamp and a note on item state change TO   STATE (entry)
  # ! - log a timestamp            on item state change FROM STATE (leave)
  #+END_SRC
- Example on subitem [[file:mylife03.org::*Change%20keyword%20to%20NEXT%20now][Change keyword to NEXT now]], change ~TODO(t@/!)~ -> ~NEXT(n/!)~:
  - before state change:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ** TODO Change keyword to NEXT now
      - This is an example for E03S01
    #+END_EXAMPLE
  - after state change:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ** NEXT Change keyword to NEXT now
     :LOGBOOK:
     - State "NEXT"       from "TODO"       [2018-11-08 Thu 16:00]
     :END:
     - This is an example for E03S01    
    #+END_EXAMPLE
- Example on subitem [[file:mylife03.org::*Change%20keyword%20to%20NEXT%20now][Change keyword to NEXT now]], change ~NEXT(n/!)~ -> ~WAITING(w@/!)~:
  - since WAITING has a ~@~, the entry change to WAITING also prompts for and
    stores a note, e.g. for a customer support job:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ** WAITING Change keyword to NEXT now
       :LOGBOOK:
       - State "WAITING"    from "NEXT"       [2018-11-08 Thu 16:07] \\
         sent out mail to customer, waiting for response
       - State "NEXT"       from "TODO"       [2018-11-08 Thu 16:00]
       :END:
       - This is an example for E03S01    
    #+END_EXAMPLE
*** Log CLOSED timestamp when something is DONE
 - For this, additionally to setting ~DONE(d@)~ in in-file todo state keywords
   setting, we can customize the variable ~org-log-done~.
   - the default value is =Record CLOSED timestamp=. We'll leave it at that.
 - Example on subitem [[file:mylife03.org::*This%20task%20is%20considered%20to%20be%20finished][This task is considered to be finished]], change TODO -> DONE:
   - before state change:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     ** TODO This task is considered to be finished
        - So please mark it done now
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - after state change:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     ** DONE This task is considered to be finished
        CLOSED: [2018-11-08 Thu 16:15]
        :LOGBOOK:
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2018-11-08 Thu 16:15] \\
          Problem solved.
        :END:
        - So please mark it done now     
     #+END_EXAMPLE
*** Log rescheduling events
- Customize variable ~org-log-reschedule~:
  - changed value to =Record timestamp with note=.
- Example on subitem [[file:mylife03.org::*The%20ugly%20task%20that%20is%20there%20for%20a%20long%20time][The ugly task that is there for a long time]]:

*** Intro
- Goal: split [[file:mylife03.org][Tutorial Agenda File3]] items into files for private and work tasks:
  - [[file:mywork03.org][Tutorial Agenda File3: Work]]
  - [[file:mylife03.org][Tutorial Agenda File3]]: Private stuff
  - Rainer Sidenote: in his personal system, he has for agenda files: one for
    private-stuff, two for the job/office/work-stuff: one for work in general,
    and one 'schedule' for scheduling projects/milestones, and one for
    club/association he's the president of. Of course, one could also have
    project-specific agenda files. *Just remember to put the files in the
    ~org-agenda-files~ list, and define ~org-refile-targets~ accordingly!*
- [X] add new agenda file to agenda file list
- for moving items from one agenda file to another /correctly/, have to
  customize some ~org-refile~ variables first
*** Prep: Sidenote: keybinding deviations for moving/archiving items/subtrees
**** The Problem
- *Problem*: here, tutor Rainer mentions that in a previous episode the commands
  =C-c C-w= for *A)* /moving items/ and =C-c M-w= for *B)* /copying items/ were
  introduced. However, I have no note of that. Further, my Spacemacs does not
  know these commands (=SPC h d k=).
**** The Task
- *Task*: I must find out now which commands I do use for these tutorial commands.
  - My [[file:~/Desktop/KEYS_EMACS_ORGMODE.org::*Capture%20-%20Refile%20-%20Archiving][KEYS_ORGMODE file > Capture - Refile - Archiving]] has A) listed as /refile
    subtree/, maybe?
  - *Found A)*: under [[*%5B%5Bhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqs06qjnkcc&list=plvtkhbrrv_zkpnbtt_td1cs9pjlu0iide&index=1%5D%5Be01s01: headlines & outline mode%5D%5D][e01s01: headlines & outline mode]]: =M-RET R=, so what Rainer
    calls /moving items/ (subtree) is actually ~org-refile~. See =SPC h d k M-RET
    R=.
  - *Found B)*: /most/ of the org functions use the word ~subtree~ instead of 'item',
    and *there is one for copying items/subtrees*. They just don't have any
    keybindings. Especially B), as used by Rainer, has no keybinding
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        org-mime-org-subtree-htmlize
        org-cut-subtree
        org-show-subtree
        org-mark-subtree (C-c @)
    --> org-copy-subtree
        org-paste-subtree
        org-demote-subtree (M-RET S l)
        org-archive-subtree (M-RET A)
        org-move-subtree-up (M-RET S k)
        org-promote-subtree (M-RET S h)
        org-list-make-subtree (C-c C-*)
        org-move-subtree-down (M-RET S j)
        org-narrow-to-subtree (M-RET n)
        org-babel-execute-subtree (C-c C-v s)
        org-archive-subtree-default (C-c C-x C-a)
        org-advertized-archive-subtree
        org-reset-checkbox-state-subtree
        org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift (C-c C-x c)
    #+END_EXAMPLE
  - *Found B) as second time*: aha, my Spacemacs actually knows B). But it's not
    bound to ~org-copy-subtree~, but to ~org-copy~:
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  C-c M-w runs the command org-copy (found in org-mode-map), which is an
  interactive Lisp closure in ‘org.el’.
   
  It is bound to C-c M-w.
   
  (org-copy)
   
  Like ‘org-refile’, but copy.
  #+END_QUOTE
**** The Result: keybindings for A) move item, and B) copy item
-                                                 emacs               spacemacs
- ~org-refile~ move item/subtree                                    =M-RET R=
- ~org-copy~ copy item/subtree                    =C-c M-w=
- (org-copy-subtree: no keybinding)
  
*** Prep: Customize ~org-refile~ variables
- ~org-refile-targets~:
  - ~INS~,
    'Choice:' ~Value Menu~ =All agenda files=
  - 'Identify target headline by:' ~Value Menu~ =Level number=
    - 'Integer:' =1=
    - Meaning: refile my things at the first level of headlines
- ~org-refile-outline-path~:
  - ~Value Menu~ =Start with file name=
- ~org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes~:
  - ~Value Menu~ =Prompt for confirmation=
  - Meaning: if in the target file a parent does not exist but i want one, then
    i can ask for conformation and i get what i want.
*** Split items into files
- important note beforehand: org mode works on the buffers, not the files. so
  you can refile stuff as you like and the agenda will reflect that, without the
  need to save the files first. once everything is in it's place, the files must
  be saved however.
**** Copy Items so they appear in both files
- =C-c M-w mywork03.org/=: *copy item* [[file:mylife03.org::*GTD%20related%20things][GTD related things]] to [[file:mywork03.org][mywork03.org]], since the item is
  both related to private-stuff and work-stuff
- =C-c C-s= reschedule private-stuff [[file:mylife03.org::*Weekly%20Review][Weekly Review]] to Sunday
  - =C-a a= now produces this:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Friday     16 November 2018
      mywork03:   Scheduled:  NEXT Weekly Review
    Saturday   17 November 2018
    Sunday     18 November 2018
      mylife03:   Scheduled:  NEXT Weekly Review
    #+END_EXAMPLE
**** Move items to other file
- =M-RET R mywork03.org/= *move item* "Consulting jobs" to [[file:mywork03.org][mywork03.org]].
**** Move items to other file nodes/topitems
- want to move subitem "The ugly task that is there for a long time" away, but
  to another topitem/headline:
- =M-RET R mywork03.org/Skeletons=: a new topitem is created and subitem moved
  there
- move item "Prepare tax declaration" to same place, now using =M-RET R
  mywork03.org/= and tab completion on items, then move it back to it's original
  location

*** Intro
- Files:
  - [[file:mylife03.org][Tutorial Agenda File3]] for private-stuff
  - [[file:mywork03.org][Tutorial Agenda File3: Work]] for work-stuff
  - Capture Templates:
    - [[file:tpl-todo.txt][tpl-todo.txt]]    
- Goal: capturing tasks, ideas and whatever
-                                                 emacs               spacemacs
- ~org-capture~                                   DEFINE-YOURSELF     =M-m C c=
- show where it went ([[http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/datetree.html][source]])                     =C-u C-u M-m C c=
- ~org-capture~ configure templates                                   =M-m C c C=
*** Example: A capture template for private-stuff TODO items 
**** The capture template file [[file:tpl-todo.txt][tpl-todo.txt]]
 - Line1:
   - template has one *, but emacs will expand to correct level when inserted
   - ~%^{Description}~ means: ~%~ prompt for variable, ~%^~ prompt for string
     variable, ~%^{bla}~ display 'bla:' when prompting
 - Line 2: ~%?~ means: cursor stops here and blinks when all prompted variables
   have been entered
 - Line 3: ~%U~ means: put a timestamp there
**** Configure the template
 - add ~INS~:
   - Choice: =Multikey description=
     - Keys: =p=
     - Description: =My private templates=.
     - save
 - add ~INS~:
   - Choice: =Template entry=
     - Keys: =pt= (means: press ~p~ -> press ~t~)
     - Description: =TODO entry=
     - Capture Type: =Org entry=
     - Target location: =File & Headline=
       - File: =absolute path to the agenda file, here .../mylife03.org=. Aside
         tip: Rainer has all these files conveniently under ~~/org~.
         - ~ValueMenu~: =Literal= I guess? In Rainer's screencast, this button is
           not present.
       - Headline: =Capture Headline for E03S03=
     - Template: =File=:
       - Template File: =abspathto tpltfile, here .../tpl-todo.txt=
     - List:
       - leave all unchecked except =Key: :empty-lines-before 1=
     - save
     - this produces the following code in dotfile:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
 '(org-capture-templates
   (quote
    (("p" "My private templates")
     ("pt" "My TODO entry" entry
      (file+headline "/home/johannes/Desktop/Archive/Reference/tool/editor/emacs/OrgmodeTutorial_RainerKoenig_2016/mylife03.org" "Capture Headline for E03S03")
      (file "/home/johannes/Desktop/Archive/Reference/tool/editor/emacs/OrgmodeTutorial_RainerKoenig_2016/tpl-todo.txt")
      :empty-lines-before 1))))
#+END_SRC
     - or, in Rainer's [[https://koenig-haunstetten.de/2014/08/29/the-power-of-orgmode-capture-templates/][capture template blog post]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
 '(org-capture-templates
   (quote 
    (("p" "Private Templates")
     ("pt" "ToDo Entry" entry
      (file+headline "~/Dropbox/org/privat.org" "Capture")
      (file "~/Dropbox/org/tpl-todo.txt")
      :empty-lines-before 1))))
#+END_SRC       
**** Use the template
- capture: =M-m C c p t=, provide a description, =C-c C-c= confirm
  - the item appears under [[file:mylife03.org::*Capture%20Headline%20for%20E03S03][Capture Headline for E03S03]]
- =M-RET C= refile to [[file:mylife03.org::*Examples][Examples]]
*** Other capture template examples
**** Journaling capture template
- like above I guess, but 
**** StuffToRead capture template
- video shows in action, no config. For config, see [[https://koenig-haunstetten.de/2016/06/25/orgmode-tutorial-episode-3/][blog post]]:
